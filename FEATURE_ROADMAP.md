- Supports novels up to 200,000 words smoothly

### Reliability
- No data loss (auto-save + backups)

---

### Tags
- Every different kind of info will be color coded. Parts dark blue, scenes aqua, chapters, orange, characters green, settings brown, world building info a nice silver... or something.
- When a tag is used, it will become that color so it is easily identifyable. 
- Tags should be in the form of words-like-this so that they can all be highlighted
- When a Chapter or scene or whatever is created, the title might look like Fallen Creator or Tash Kalmanes... the tag should be auto created to be fallen-creator and tash-kalmanes so it can be referenced accordingly. 
- There should be a database or place
