# Questions for the author

Written by Claude during unattended `/goal` runs. Each entry is a decision Claude made without
waiting (recorded in `FEATURES.md` as "decided by Claude, unconfirmed"), or a step only the author can
do. Review, then confirm, change, or delete the entry.

## 2026-10-06 · F-5.19 · Chat router instead of native tool calling
- Question: How should the chat "act by itself" (rewrite, proofread, synopsis, …) when the provider layer and the Cloud Worker do not support tool calling?
- Chosen: a router: one cheap `fast` JSON call (`route.v1`, feature `route`, its own toggle and ledger line) picks the action, then the existing feature runs unchanged. An exact action name or a message without letters skips the call; anything unreadable falls back to plain chat.
- Alternatives: native tool calling (needs a provider-interface change and a Cloud Worker redeploy, an operator step); keyword matching only (free, but misses most phrasings).
- To change it: `src/shared/assistantRoute.ts`, `src/main/ai/route.ts`, `src/main/ai/prompts/route.v1.ts`.

## 2026-10-06 · F-5.20 · What the synopsis and notes suggestions read, and what the chat sees
- Question: What context goes into a suggested synopsis and suggested notes, and how much of the side panel does the chat see?
- Chosen: synopsis = the first 12,000 characters of the scene + its stored summary; notes = the same scene text + summary + brief + the first 1,500 characters of the current notes + the story bible + an optional focus, up to 8 points of 200 characters. The chat and Story Intelligence see the synopsis and the first 1,500 characters of the notes; Story Intelligence may not cite them. Both suggestions need 100 characters of scene text and a manuscript scene.
- Alternatives: include the voice profile (not prose, so no); send the whole notes (cost).
- To change it: `src/shared/sceneSuggest.ts`, `src/main/ai/sceneSuggest.ts`, `src/main/ai/prompts/chat.v5.ts`, `src/main/ai/prompts/query.v4.ts`.

## 2026-10-06 · F-12.2 · Where imported parts land in a project with content
- Question: when importing into a project that already has parts, should the imported chapters go into the last existing part, or arrive as new parts?
- Chosen: new parts after the project's own, marked New in the combined outline; the author drags chapters into an existing part (or uses Move up / Move down).
- Alternatives: pour the chapters of a file without real parts into the last existing part.
- To change it: `withExisting` in `src/main/import/existing.ts`.

## 2026-10-06 · F-12.2 · Generic documents inside a deleted part or chapter
- Question: the combined outline shows only parts, chapters, and scenes; what happens to a generic document or folder inside a part or chapter the author deletes in the review?
- Chosen: it moves to the end of the manuscript instead of being deleted with its container (nothing outside the outline is ever deleted).
- Alternatives: delete it with the container and list it in the "In your project" line; refuse the delete.
- To change it: the hidden-children step in `importDraft`, `src/main/import/commit.ts`.

## 2026-10-06 · F-12.2 · Import to start: no AI pass, format does not relabel
- Question: should the welcome screen's import offer the AI structure pass (F-12.3), and should changing the format relabel the draft's default titles?
- Chosen: no AI pass (the new project has no AI settings or key choice yet; run Import again from inside the project to use it); default titles stay as read (Part/Chapter/Scene N).
- Alternatives: offer the pass with app-wide settings; relabel `Scene N`/`Chapter N`/`Part N` when the format changes.
- To change it: `open()` in `src/renderer/features/import/importStore.ts`.

## 2026-10-06 · F-12.2 · Title lines become chapters
- Question: how strict is "a title at the beginning of a scene"?
- Chosen: a line after a scene break or a part heading, followed by prose, with no ending punctuation, an upper-case letter or digit first, at most 8 words and 60 characters, and all caps, Title Case, or three words or fewer. The file's first line counts only when the file marks no chapters itself (so a book title above Chapter 1 stays front matter). A closing "THE END" with nothing after it stays prose.
- Alternatives: also promote a short line right after a `Chapter N` heading into the chapter's title ("Chapter 1: The Return"); require all caps.
- To change it: `isTitleLine` and `promoteTitleLines` in `src/main/import/structure.ts`.

## 2026-10-06 · F-14.14 · Learned voice (automatic exemplars and style notes)
- Question: how should the voice profile learn on its own, as asked ("scan occasionally on new stuff")?
- Chosen: a local `voice` job re-picks up to 6 automatic exemplars from the author's own paragraphs every 1,500 words of change (no AI, no cost; AI-origin text excluded, imported text included); AI-made style notes (`voiceNotes.v1`, fast tier, ≤ 8 notes) refreshed every 5,000 words once the manuscript holds 2,000, at Ask or higher with its own toggle; the notes ride inside the existing 600-token voice block (200 tokens for notes), so no prompt version was bumped. Clear empties the notes until 5,000 more words; removing an automatic exemplar remembers it. Hand-marked exemplars stay and rank first; their 12-row cap no longer counts automatic ones.
- Alternatives: re-pick on a timer instead of word counts; let the notes replace the stylometric rules; give the notes their own budget outside the voice block (a token increase on every prose prompt); a per-scene notes pass on the summary job instead of a project-level one.
- To change it: thresholds in `src/shared/voice.ts`; selection in `src/main/voice/autoExemplars.ts`; notes in `src/main/ai/voiceNotes.ts` and `prompts/voiceNotes.v1.ts`; the block in `src/main/voice/voiceBlock.ts`.
